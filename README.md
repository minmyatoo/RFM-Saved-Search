## What's RFM? üëÄ

RFM segmentation helps marketers target customers more effectively. RFM stands for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary, a method that identifies valuable customers by analyzing their purchase history. It groups customers based on how recently they bought üìÖ, how often they buy üîÑ, and how much they spend üí∞.

This segmentation allows for tailored marketing strategies. For example, recent big spenders might get a "VIP customer" offer, while inactive customers could receive a "win-back" promotion.

RFM is a powerful tool for boosting customer engagement and sales. üöÄ
